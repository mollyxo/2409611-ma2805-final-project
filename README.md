Cat and Mouse
Group Responsibilities
Tyreese & Liz - Digital Art Evie - TileMap Emma - Classes Molly & Michaella - Movement

Our initial game idea
Our game will feature a mouse sprite that is working its way through a maze (4 different scenes, each season)

When player gets to the end of each part of the maze, the screen will swipe over to the next part.

Our Sprites
Mouse Each level will have another cat as an enemy following the cat - if player hits the cat = they get taken back to the beginning. Different items for different seasons - e.g winter = snowballs Hedges/Stones/Grass the player has to navigate around - they cannot go through it (Collision Map)

Additional Features
We will have pieces of cheese that the player picks up as they go through the maze that increases their speed.

Contributions
For movement and moving the player I used the function ‘keyPressed()’ to have the player react every time a key is pressed
I started it with player.setDirection()' and continued with creating a new method. This was done with others in the group also.
